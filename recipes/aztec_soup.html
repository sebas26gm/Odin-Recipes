    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> This recipe is for a natural Aztec Soup. This soup is made up from vegetables completely! The end product should
        be made up of a mixture of different vegetables (for seasoning), but mainly consist of tomatoes - because it's a
        tomato soup. Besides, the soup is usually served with toppings such as cheese, tortilla chips, hot souce, and
        avocado! It's a fast recipe to cook, and a delicious (usually) vegetarian meal!</p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Tomatoes (4 o 5)</li>
        <li> One Celery</li>
        <li>One Red Pepper</li>
        <li>One Onion</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li> Garlic</li>
        <li> Powdered Pepper</li>
        <li> Salt</li>
        <li> Natural tomato souce</li>
        <li>Hot sauce <em>(Optional)</em></li>
        <li>Jalapeno <em>(Optional)</em></li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
        <li> Cheese</li>
        <li> Tortilla Chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Boil water, and put all the veggies in. It would be best if you chopped the ingredients a bit, not tiny,
            just enough so they're not boiled as the whole vegetable.</li>
        <li>Once Vegetables are done, put them all in the blender. Fill half the blender with water, and mix thoroughly.
            The mixture should end up with a red-ish look.</li>
        <li>Fill a cooking pot with the liquid mixture. Add a bit of tomato sauce, and season to your taste. Wait until
            the soup boils.</li>
        <li>Chop the cheese (skip this step if you bought shredded mozzarella).</li>
        <li>Chop the avocado into slices or small chunks.</li>
        <li>Finally, serve the soup, and add into it the cheese, avocado, tortilla chips, and any other sides you'd
            like!</li>
    </ol>
